## Overview
 This is a front-end web development project 3 for Treehouse Techdegree. Start from scratch, I took my time writing out my own HTML and CSS. From what I've learned from previous courses, I was able to create a registration form using HTML tags. I used the HTML5 required attrtibute which won't let a user submit the form unless that field is filled out. I styled the form for the mobile first, including all of the global styles, fonts, colors etc.
 
 ## Skills
- HTML
- CSS

## Conclusion
One of the things I hope to improve on is how to organize my CSS in the best way possible. While I was styling the form by going through many trials, CSS became very unorganized. I hope this will get better as I go further in development.
